    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p><img src= "CJ3A0086.jpg" alt= "Picture of myself" style="float:right;width:500px;height:600px;"> I am a Computational Media major at 
        Georgia Tech. My areas of study include game design and artificial intelligence. <br><br> I really enjoy coding because I enjoy problem 
        solving and figuring out the solution the problem. I chose game design because of my love for video games. I have always enjoyed video 
        games and I feel like creating video games would be the most fun job I could think of. Game design incorporates my love of coding and 
        my love for video games. I chose to study intelligence because of the idea of robots and artificial intelligence has always fascinated me ever since I was a child.
